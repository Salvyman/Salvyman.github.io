                I first started when I was in highschool and have recently rediscovered my passion for Photography and video editing. 
                I love photography because it allows me to capture moments frozen in time, preserving memories that I can cherish forever. 
                Through my lens, I explore the world with a unique perspective, finding beauty in the ordinary and extraordinary alike.
                 Photography empowers me to express myself creatively and share my vision with others, fostering connections and sparking emotions beyond words.
